<h2 style="border:5px solid SlateBlue;">Lake Superior</h2>
		<p> Lake Superior is rife with ghost stories. How could it not be with a location dubbed the "Graveyard of the Great Lakes" and one of the top ten haunted lakes in the world? The Lake's chilling tales range from ghost ships to haunted places, lonely lightkeepers to woeful shores.</p>

<h2 style="border:5px solid SlateBlue;">Lake Natron</h2>
		<p> This body of water is part of the larger Lake Natron Basin and is located in the Arusha Region of Tanzania. It is an extremely important wetland region that, due to its high temperatures and dangerous waters, isn't exactly teeming with wildlife. </p>

The water is a striking blood red colour with textured segments that look like wonky geometric shapes on the lake floor. Large green mountains can be seen in the distance, reflecting into the water." width="350" height="200" </p>

<h2 style="border:5px solid SlateBlue;">Lake Baikal</h2>
		<p> It is the deepest lake in the world, with a depth of 1642 metres. What's going on down there... It is not only the deepest lake in the world, but also the oldest and largest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is located in Russia, north of the Mongolian border. Lake Baikal has its own Loch Ness Monster, known as "Lusud-Khan" (which translates to "Water Dragon Master"). It's a "giant sturgeon with a prominent snout and armoured plating along the back," according to the description. The monster has a long history, with ancient carvings depicting the terrifying creature. </p>
